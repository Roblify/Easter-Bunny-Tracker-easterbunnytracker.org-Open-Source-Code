The compiler.py is a file that fetches your route.json file (inside your data folder) and changes the unix timestamps to be up to the date with the date of your choice.





Inside the compiler.py file, at this section of the code:

    ap.add_argument(
        "--day1",
        default="2027-03-27", # CHANGE TO DATE OF YOUR CHOICE (YYYY-MM-DD)
        help="Target date for day 1 (YYYY-MM-DD). Default: 2027-03-27" # CHANGE TO DATE OF YOUR CHOICE (YYYY-MM-DD)
    )
    ap.add_argument(
        "--day2",
        default="2027-03-28", # CHANGE TO DATE OF YOUR CHOICE (YYYY-MM-DD) DISCLAIMER: DAY 2 IS ALWAYS EASTER DAY
        help="Target date for day 2 (YYYY-MM-DD). Default: 2027-03-28" # CHANGE TO DATE OF YOUR CHOICE (YYYY-MM-DD)
    )


You want to change the day 1 date to whichever the upcoming Easter Eve date is. 
You want to change the day 2 date to whichever the upcoming Easter Day date is.


You must do so in the tools/compiler.py itself. Changing it in this file will have no affect.



How to execute:
After making the change, be sure to save the new file (by using CTRL + S on your keyboard).
Open up your terminal (or Command Prompt, whichever you use) and type the following:

python tools/compiler.py

OR:

python tools\compiler.py

OR:

py tools\compiler.py


Whichever command works on your system should be used. The script will run using the Python version that is installed and configured on your device.
Note: You are required to install Python on your device in order to work on the tracker. You can do so through this website: https://www.python.org/downloads/



After running the line, if you see the following:

Done. Updated in-place: data\route.json
Pretty field: Pretty Arrival EDT 2026
Mapped original dates -> target dates:
  2026-04-04 -> 2027-03-27
  2026-04-05 -> 2027-03-28


Then that means the compiler has successfully done it's job and updated the route.json file. If it doesn't and outputs an error, figure it out from there.
